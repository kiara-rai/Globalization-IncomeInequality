<div id = "text"> India in the 1980s and 1990s witnessed significant changes in its economic and social landscape, particularly in terms of globalization and income inequality. The most significant transformation occurred in 1991 when India initiated a series of economic reforms. This period, often referred to as the "New Economic Policy" or "Liberalization," marked the new change from India's previous closed and regulated economy. The government, led by then-Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, introduced measures to liberalize trade, reduce import restrictions, and promote foreign direct investment (FDI). This policy shift was aimed at integrating India into the global economy. </div>

<div id= text2>This liberalization of the Indian economy was a key driver of globalization. India began to actively engage with the global economy by reducing trade barriers and encouraging foreign investments. This led to increased trade and economic interactions with other countries, which contributed to India's economic growth and industrial development. The 1990s also saw the rise of India as a hub for information technology (IT) and outsourcing services. Indian IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, and Tata Consultancy Services gained prominence globally. The IT and BPO sectors played a crucial role in India's integration into the global economy.

<div id="text2">While globalization and economic reforms had positive effects on India's economy in terms of GDP growth and foreign investment, they also brought about income inequality. Income inequality increased during this period as the benefits of economic growth were not equally distributed. Urban areas, where industries and the service sector thrived, saw more significant income gains compared to rural areas. These two decades also witnessed the growth of an emerging middle class in India. This middle class benefited from economic liberalization and globalization and saw improvements in their living standards. It played a crucial role in driving consumer demand and shaping India's consumer culture.</div>
