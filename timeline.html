The colonial administration had exploited India's resources and manpower to serve British interests, leading to significant economic disparities and underdevelopment in various regions. India faced food shortages and famine conditions in various regions. This led to an urgent need to address food security issues and ensure an adequate food supply for the growing population.</p>

				India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, pursued a policy of economic self-sufficiency and industrialization through the Five-Year Plans. The government promoted the establishment of public sector industries to reduce dependence on foreign goods and technology. It imposed strict controls on foreign trade and exchange rates to protect domestic industries and conserve foreign exchange reserves. India adopted a policy of import substitution, aiming to produce domestically what had been previously imported. This strategy was intended to reduce dependence on foreign goods.
