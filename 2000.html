<div id = "text" class="animated"> India continued to actively pursue globalization during the 2000's to 2010's. Economic reforms, trade liberalization, and efforts to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) helped integrate the Indian economy more deeply into the global marketplace.  India negotiated and signed trade agreements with various countries and regions, promoting cross-border trade and investment. It attracted foreign investment in sectors such as telecommunications, retail, and real estate, leading to increased FDI. This foreign capital contributed to infrastructure development, further integrating India into the global economy. </div>

The urban-rural income gap remained a significant concern, as urban areas experienced more substantial economic growth and development.  Income inequality in India was also evident in wealth disparities, with a small segment of the population amassing significant wealth while a large portion continued to struggle with poverty and limited access to basic services.
